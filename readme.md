# Domainator

Keep Track Of Your Domains, The Easy Way.

Domainator is a simple tool to that helps you keep track of your domains by monitoring the expiration of TLS certificates and notifying you before they expire.

## Env Vars

Make a copy of `.env.test` and name it `.env`. Replace the values within it.

## 3rd party tools

In addition to `go` and `make`. You will need:

- `air` for hot reloading
- `templ` for html templating

You may install them with `make deps`.

To run `make lint`, you will need [golangci-lint](golang.org/x/lint/golint).

## Components

Domainator consists of two components:
- **Server**: the webserver.
- **Worker**: a background worker that updates certificates data, meant to be run as a cron job.

## Worker

The worker is meant to be run as a cron job. Multiple workers can be run in parallel as they will select different rows for the database to update.

Build it:
```shell
make worker build
```

Run it:
```shell
POSTGRES_CONN_STR=postgresql://u:p@h:p/domainator ./domainator_worker
```

Run it (readinv vars from env file):
```shell
ENV_FILE=/abs/path/to/.env ./domainator_worker
```
